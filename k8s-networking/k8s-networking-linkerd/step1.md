- start a 2-node Kubernetes cluster
- setup required environmental variables

Check what pods are deployed in _kube-system_ namespace:

`kubectl get pods -n kube-system`{{execute}}

Let's also make sure that the linkerd CLI was succesfully installed.

`linkerd version`{{execute}}

And check if the cluster is ready for the control plane installation

`linkerd check --pre`{{execute}}

Once all the checks are green, proceed to the next step ðŸ‘Ÿ

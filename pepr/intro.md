Kubernetes management often involves complex configurations, scattered scripts,
and cumbersome YAML files. Pepr is **Kubernetes middleware** and addresses this
issue by offering a type-safe,
TypeScript-based approach to defining configurations modules. 

### With Pepr, you can:
- Define K8s transformations using TypeScript
- Simplify operations with plain-English configurations
- Convert organizational knowledge into maintainable code
- Streamline mutations, validations, and resource watching

### Key Features:
- Zero-config K8s webhook operations
- Lightweight async key-value store
- Human-readable fluent API
- Generate and modify K8s resources dynamically
- Realtime debugging and least-privilege RBAC

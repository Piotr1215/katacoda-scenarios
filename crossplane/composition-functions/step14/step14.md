## Are labels really applied?

As the last step we are going to install our function and compositon into the
local cluster:

First notice that we have added the `xrd.yaml`{{}} file to the example folder as
well as adjusted the compositon and xr to fulfill Crossplane's requirements. Our
`function-simple-label`{{}} has been published to a repository and added to the
`functions.yaml`{{}} as another installation target.

> ðŸ“– to learn how to build and publish composition functions, visit [Crossplane docs](https://docs.crossplane.io/v1.14/concepts/composition-functions/#write-a-composition-function).

### Let's apply some YAML

`kubectl apply -f example/composition.yaml,example/xrd.yaml,example/functions.yaml`{{exec}}

Once everything is applied, we can apply our xr: `kubectl apply -f example/xr.yaml`{{exec}}

### Checking managed resources


- `start_tmux.sh`{{exec}}
- `send_command 0 "watch kubectl get nopresources --show-labels"`{{exec}}
- `send_command 1 "watch kubectl get crossplane"`{{exec}}

The labels should be added as per our specification!

> Now you can open [Komoplane]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_8090}}) and check what we have
> deployed.

## Explore on your own

Use `komoplane`{{}} and `Crossplane`{{}} to modify the function and experiment
with installing, building and other commands from the `crossplane` CLI.

You can for example add a `label`{{}} field to the `xrd`{{}} and pass it to the
composition function input or change the label value.

## Next Step

If you have made it this far, thank you and congratulation ðŸŽ‰.
This is the end of the tutorial. You have learned about developing and
testing Crossplane Composition Functions.

Next step is to create your own function solving a real business need or just
for fun. Since now the compositions can be rendered using Touring-complete
languages, the possibilities are quiet literally endless!

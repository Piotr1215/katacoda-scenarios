## Create simple function

<!-- TODO: 5. create simple function logic -->

We are going to clone a repository with an existing function and go through the
development process.

`git clone https://github.com/Piotr1215/function-auto-ready.git`{{exec}}

The initial state of the repository is just a function scaffolding, with each
step we will add more code and explain the development.

Check if the function is correctly deployed:

`cd function-auto-ready && go test ./...`{{exec}}

## Unit Tests

All the unit tests for the function are stored in the **fn_test.go** file.

Let's run the tests:

`go test -v -cover .`{{exec}}

## Explore on your own

This environment has `komoplane`{{}} and `Crossplane`{{}} installed, feel free
to modify the function and experiment with installing, building and other
commands from the `crossplane` CLI.

## Next Step

If you have made it this far, thank you and congratulation ðŸŽ‰.
This is the end of the tutorial. You have learned about developing and
testing Crossplane Composition Functions.

Next step is to create your own function solving a real business need or just
for fun. Since now the compositions can be rendered using Touring-complete
languages, the possibilities are quiet literally endless!

# Congratulations!

You've successfully created a bash script that:
- Uses strict mode for error catching
- Defines and uses functions
- Handles command-line arguments
- Validates user input
- Uses conditional logic with case statements
- Creates files based on user input using loops and arrays
- Manipulates strings and file paths

Here's a summary of what you've learned:
- How to structure a bash script with proper error handling
- Using functions to organize and reuse code
- Handling command-line arguments and providing usage information
- Input validation techniques using loops and regular expressions
- Conditional statements with case for multiple conditions
- Working with arrays and loops for file creation
- String manipulation and parameter expansion in bash

Feel free to modify the script further or use it as a foundation for more complex bash scripts!

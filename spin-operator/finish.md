## What we've accomplished

In this scenario, we've:

1. Learned about `WebAssembly` and its key features
2. Installed and used the `Spin CLI` to create a WASM-based microservice
3. Built and run a sample Spin application
4. Explored the `Spin Operator` and its role in Kubernetes environments
5. Deployed a Spin application to a Kubernetes cluster using the Spin Operator

## Key Takeaways

- WebAssembly is a powerful technology that enables high-performance, language-agnostic web applications
- Spin simplifies the process of creating and managing WASM-based microservices
- The Spin Operator extends Kubernetes to natively support WASM applications, streamlining deployment and management

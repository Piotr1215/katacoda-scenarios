WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level, assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance. 
It allows code written in various languages, such as C, C++, and Rust, to run on the web alongside JavaScript, leveraging both its performance and flexibility.

### Key Features
- **Portable and Efficient**: Designed to run on various platforms and devices efficiently.
- **Secure**: Runs in a sandboxed environment, enhancing security.
- **Interoperable**: Works alongside JavaScript, enabling shared functionality in web applications.


### Early Beginnings
- **2015**: WebAssembly was announced as a collaborative effort among major browser vendors.
- **2017**: Officially released and started gaining support across all major browsers.
- **2019**: Became a W3C recommendation, marking it as a web standard.

### Evolution
- Initially developed to address the performance limitations of JavaScript.
- Supported by various tools and languages, broadening its usability and adoption.
- Continuous improvements and features added, such as multithreading and garbage collection, enhance its capabilities for more complex applications.

### Impact
- **High Performance**: Enables high-performance applications, such as games and complex web apps, to run smoothly on the web.
- **Widespread Adoption**: Supported by all major browsers and integrated into many web development workflows.

## Introduction

This workshop will help you understand how composition functions work in
Crossplane. We are going to create and use a simple Go function.

> At the end of this tutorial you will:

- ðŸ¦‰ Understand how to develop and test a simple Go composition function
- ðŸ§± Apply the function in a real world composition

> After that head over to [Upbound Cloud](https://www.upbound.io/),create a free
> account, select one or more providers, configuration started packs and
> functions from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io/) and
> provision your own cloud infrastructure, including using functions.

What makes Crossplane so special? First, it builds on Kubernetes and capitalizes
on the fact that the real power of Kubernetes is its powerful API model and
control plane logic (control loops). It also moves away from Infrastructure as
Code to Infrastructure as Data. The difference is that IaC means writing code to
describe how the provisioning should happen, whereas IaD means writing pure data
files (about Kubernetes YAML) and submitting them to the control
component (about Kubernetes an operator) to encapsulate and execute the
provisioning logic.

The best part about Crossplane is that it seamlessly enables collaboration
between Application Teams and Platform Teams, by leveraging
[Kubernetes Control](https://containerjournal.com/kubeconcnc/kubernetes-true-superpower-is-its-control-plane/)
Plane as the convergence point where everyone meets.

## High Level Architecture

> For a more overview of Crossplane, check out this

> comprehensive [Crossplane Docs](https://crossplane.io/docs/v1.6/).

Below diagram explains Crossplane's components and their relations.

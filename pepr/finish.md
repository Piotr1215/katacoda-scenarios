## You made it ðŸŽ‰

`Pepr` is a very interesting project. In many ways it's a crossover between
`kyverno` and `shell-operator`. Its abstractions of `capabilities`, `modules`
and `actions` provide a clear framework to express variety of IT related
operations. 

Visit [pepr's GitHub ](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr) repo and [docs](https://docs.pepr.dev/v0.33.0/) to learn more about the project.

Join the Kubernetes [Slack channel](https://pepr.dev/slack) and visit the #pepr room to chat with the
maintainers and community.

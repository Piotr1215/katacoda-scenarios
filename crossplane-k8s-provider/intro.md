# Composition with Crossplane

This workshop will help you understand Crossplane architecture and use cases.

What makes Crossplane so special? First, it builds on Kubernetes and capitalizes on the fact that the real power of Kubernetes is its powerful API model and control plane logic (control loops). It also moves away from Infrastructure as Code to Infrastructure as Data. The difference is that IaC means writing code to describe how the provisioning should happen, whereas IaD means writing pure data files (in the case of Kubernetes YAML) and submitting them to the control component (in the case of Kubernetes an operator) to encapsulate and execute the provisioning logic.

The best part about Crossplane is that it seamlessly enables collaboration between Application Teams and Platform Teams, by leveraging [Kubernetes Control](https://containerjournal.com/kubeconcnc/kubernetes-true-superpower-is-its-control-plane/) Plane as the convergence point where everyone meets.

## Kubernetes Provider

> Crossplane can compose infrastructure from various providers and most common usecase is cloud infrastructure. However, composing cloud infrastructure requires access to cloud and storing credentials in a secret. This is obviously not safe and that's why we will use Kubernetes Provider. All the Crossplane concepts and techniques equally apply to cloud provider infrastructure.

By utilizing [Kubernetes provider](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-kubernetes), it's possible to control what Kubernetes resources are being created. It also enables complexity hiding for developers not familiar with [Kubernetes Resource Model](https://github.com/Kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/architecture/resource-management.md). In this scenario we will deploy a Kubernetes application consisting of:

- deployment
- service
- ingress
- horizontal pod autoscaler

Instead of exposing the resources directly to developers who might be inexperience with Kubernetes, we will create a simple composition containing only important fields, such as:

- namespace to deploy to
- image with tag
- name of the host for ingress

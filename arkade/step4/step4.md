Now our cluster is ready and apps are being installed as we speak. We didn't
need to navigate to different repositories, search for helm charts or write any
YAML files. 

Let's see what command line tools are available in arkade.

```bash
arkade get
```{{exec}}

And let's install a few.

```bash
arkade get vcluster viddy yq 
```{{exec}}

Easy as pie ðŸ¥§!

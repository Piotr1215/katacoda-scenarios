## Introduction

Before we start exploring _vcluster_, let's understand what it is and what benefits it provides.

> Definition: Virtual clusters are fully functional Kubernetes clusters nested inside a physical host cluster providing better isolation and flexibility to support multi-tenancy. Multiple teams can operate independently within the same physical infrastructure while minimizing conflicts, maximizing autonomy, and reducing costs.

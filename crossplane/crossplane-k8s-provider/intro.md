# Reduce toil with Crossplane Kubernetes provider

This workshop will help you understand how to use Crossplane's Kubernetes
provider to reduce toil and simplify developing on Kubernetes.

The goals of the workshop:

- Understand how Crossplane's Kubernetes provider can provide a unified API for developers to create repeatable deployments
- Learn about and see basic building blocks in action
- Go through real world scenarios of creating, consuming and managing internal
  platform

> At the end of this tutorial you will be able to create a free account in
> [Upbound Cloud](https://www.upbound.io/) and try provisioning cloud
> infrastructure youself!

What makes Crossplane so special? First, it builds on Kubernetes and capitalizes
on the fact that the real power of Kubernetes is its powerful API model and
control plane logic (control loops). It also moves away from Infrastructure as
Code to Control Plane architecture. 

The difference is that IaC means writing code to describe how the provisioning
should happen, whereas the control plane provides management and orchestration
of services across an organizationâ€™s cloud environment. The control plane takes
care of establishing policy.

The best part about this approach is that it seamlessly enables collaboration
between Application Teams and Platform Teams, by leveraging
[Kubernetes Control](https://containerjournal.com/kubeconcnc/kubernetes-true-superpower-is-its-control-plane/)
Plane as the convergence point where everyone meets.
